# mIRC Script Archive

## Important Notice

All of these scripts were written by me almost a decade ago. They are quite honestly terrible and
have only been uploaded to GitHub for archival purposes. You will not receive any support for
anything in this repository and all patches will be rejected. Don't say you haven't been warned.

## Script List
